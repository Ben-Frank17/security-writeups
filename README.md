# Security Writeups — Braxton (Ben-Frank17)

This repository is a portfolio of short, reproducible security lab writeups and evidence.  
It demonstrates basic web testing skills and recon techniques performed in isolated, authorized labs (DVWA, TryHackMe).

## Structure
- **/dvwa/** — DVWA lab writeups, screenshots, and scan artifacts.  
  - `dvwa_sql_injection.md` — SQL injection PoC and remediation.  
  - `dvwa_cmd_injection.md` — Command injection PoC and remediation.  
  - `dvwa_xss_reflected.md` — Reflected XSS PoC.  
  - `dvwa_nmap.txt` — Local host recon output.

## How to read this repo
Open files in the `dvwa` folder. Each writeup follows the same format:
- Summary  
- PoC (payload + reproduction steps)  
- Evidence (screenshot filenames)  
- Impact and remediation steps

## About me
Braxton (Ben-Frank17) — cybersecurity student, USMC veteran. I use these labs to build repeatable testing skills and create client-ready micro-scan deliverables.

## Use & Disclaimer
All testing shown was performed in a controlled, authorized lab. Do not run these techniques against systems you do not own or have explicit permission to test.
