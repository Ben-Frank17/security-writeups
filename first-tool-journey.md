*Date: 2025-09-27*
*Author: Braxton*
## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objective
Create a functional port scanner in Python to understand network programming and ethical scanning practices.
## ðŸ“š What I Learned
### Technical Skills
- **Socket Programming**: How Python communicates over networks
- **Error Handling**: Dealing with timeouts and connection issues
- **Command Line Arguments**: Making tools configurable with argparse
- **File I/O**: Saving results to files for later analysis
- **Color Output**: Making terminal output more readable

### Cybersecurity Concepts
- **Port Scanning**: Identifying open services on systems
- **Ethical Considerations**: Only scanning authorized targets like scanme.nmap.org
- **Network Reconnaissance**: Basic information gathering techniques
- **Service Identification**: Common ports and their purposes (SSH=22, HTTP=80, etc.)
## ðŸ”§ Tool Evolution

### Version 1: Basic Scanner
Basic port scanning functionality

### Version 2: Enhanced Features
- Color-coded output
- File saving capability
- Custom port ranges
- Better error handling
## ðŸš€ Challenges Overcome
1. Python environment setup
2. Network programming basics
3. Tool design and enhancement

## ðŸ“Š Results
Successfully created a working port scanner that can:
- Scan multiple ports
- Display results with colors
- Save output to files
- Accept command-line arguments

## ðŸ’¡ Key Takeaways
Building tools teaches more than using them!
